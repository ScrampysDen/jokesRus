  <h4 class="text-center text-warning">776 Suffield Street Agawam MA</h4>
  <h4 class="text-center text-warning">(413)214-9575</h4>
  <h4 class="text-center text-warning">Ann Smith • Kathryne Smith • Matthew Smith • 
   Trent Smith • Amanda Easton • Ann Smith • Anne Rooney • Chereece Smith • David Smith • 
   Derek Martinelli • Dianne Smith • Eric Smith • Josephine Smith</h4>
  <h4 class="text-center text-warning">Alex Smith aka: Mr Bi-Polar was raised in the town of agawam Mass with no father and a mom
  that couldn't name the dude she slept with the night before due to here excesive drinking problem.</h4>
  <p>He grew up thinking he was better than everyone else, thought he knew everything and to this day still carries this persona 
  with him... probably will until he jumps off a bridge under the fact he has a very very small brain.. (im sure you thought we were going to say penis which
  in fact is also true. The only person who will say that he does is his underage girlfriend who he started to date when she was 15 years old and he was 23)
  Getting back to the important stuff. He has an abundance of these issues from his mental illness, which was provoked after letting shit that dosen't matter effect him for several
  years.. i.e having a small dick, thinking he's always right, lying to his underage girlfriend about how many girls he slept with, lying about his job and telling people hes a lawyer.. 
  you know things like that. The boy is an all around scumbag, who never once got into a fight and probably should meet someone who will beat his already scarred fucked up looking face
  into the pavement. Probably do him some good. Maybe he can get his dad to help him out... oh wait thats right... </p>
